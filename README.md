# 🧠 Brain-Stroke-Detection-using-ENSNET

Welcome to the **Brain Stroke Detection App** powered by **ENSNET (Ensemble Segmentation Network)**!  
This web app is designed to **detect and segment brain strokes from CT scans** using state-of-the-art deep learning models.  
The app provides an intuitive **Streamlit-based interface** that allows you to upload CT images, visualize the detected hemorrhage regions, and understand model predictions in real time.

This project integrates multiple segmentation and classification models such as **DeepLabV3** variants and an **ensemble ENSNET model** for high-accuracy stroke localization.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

* Detects stroke-affected regions in **CT scan images**  
* Classifies strokes as **Hemorrhagic** or **Ischemic**  
* Provides **segmentation overlays** for visual understanding   


## 🧠 Output Example

Below is an example output from the Streamlit app showing stroke type classification and segmentation comparison.
